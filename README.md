Readme file for Swagger Implementation in Node.js Express.js
This is a guide on how to implement Swagger in a Node.js Express.js application. Swagger is a powerful tool for documenting and testing RESTful APIs. It provides a clear and easy-to-understand interface for developers to interact with, which can make the development process much smoother.

# Prerequisites
Before we get started, you should have the following installed:

Node.js (version 12 or higher)
npm (or yarn)

# Setup

## Step 1: Create a new Node.js project
Create a new directory for your project and initialize it with npm:

mkdir my-project
cd my-project
npm init -y

## Step 2: Install Express.js
Install Express.js using npm:

npm install express

## Step 3: Install Swagger
Install Swagger using npm:

npm install swagger-ui-express

## Step 4: Create a new file for your server
Create a new file called server.js in the root directory of your project. This file will be the entry point for your application.

const express = require('express');
const swaggerUi = require('swagger-ui-express');
const YAML = require('yamljs');
const swaggerDocument = YAML.load('./swagger.yaml');

const app = express();

app.use('/api-docs', swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(swaggerDocument));

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});

## Step 5: Create a Swagger YAML/ Js file
Create a new file called swagger.yaml in the root directory of your project. This file will contain the Swagger specification for your API.
create a new file called swagger.js
